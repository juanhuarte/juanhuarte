## Final Project 


This project describes the design of a portable low-power signal acquisition and wireless transmitter device with autonomous power. Its function is to acquire an analog signal with a maximum bandwidth of 10KHz and two range amplitudes of ± 10V and ± 100mV. This must be done keeping a minimum dynamic range of 60dB for both cases. Then the digitized signal has to be transmitted wirelessly to an external receiver where the samples are saved and eventually, its visualization is allowed.


This work consists in the design of the device, starting from the analog stage of acquisition, adaptation and conditioning, following with the stage of digital conversion and processing, and ending with the transmission and reception. Additionally, was designed the device's own power supply adapted to its portable characteristics.
